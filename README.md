# FerrumLinker 🚀🌐

This is a simple TCP stream forwarder 🔄 built for the use with FerrumServe implemented using tokio, futures, and bytes crates in Rust 🦀.</br> This program forwards data from standard input (stdin) to a specified TCP server and relays the server's responses back to the standard output (stdout).

## Building 📦

- Run cargo run <server_address> to start the program, replacing <server_address> with the desired TCP server address (e.g., 127.0.0.1:8080).
